# TryHackMe Writeups

Welcome to my collection of TryHackMe writeups! ðŸš€

This repository contains detailed walkthroughs for various TryHackMe rooms, highlighting different techniques, tools, and methodologies used in cybersecurity challenges. The writeups are meant to help both beginners and intermediate users understand the steps involved in solving each room, and to serve as a reference for common attack vectors, defenses, and problem-solving strategies.

## A Brain Unraveled by Knowledge ðŸŒ€

As I write these, I feel like Iâ€™m both assembling the puzzle and tearing it apart at the same time. Each piece of data a burden, each vulnerability discovered pulling me deeper into the rabbit hole. The more I learn, the more tangled the web becomes. Patterns emerging, then collapsing into chaos. I try to document what I can...  If you follow these steps, beware: clarity is fleeting, and the journey is relentless. So Good Luck
