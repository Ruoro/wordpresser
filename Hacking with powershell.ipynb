    "# Task 2 What is Powershell?\n",
    "Powershell is the Windows Scripting Language and shell environment built using the `.NET framework`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This also allows Powershell to **execute .NET functions** directly from its shell. Most Powershell commands, called cmdlets, are written in `.NET`. Unlike other scripting languages and shell environments, the output of these cmdlets are objects - making Powershell somewhat *object-oriented*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that running cmdlets allows you to perform actions on the output object (which makes it convenient to pass output from one cmdlet to another). The normal format of a cmdlet is represented using Verb-Noun; for example, the cmdlet to list commands is called Get-Command\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Common verbs to use include:\n",
    "- Get\n",

    "# Task 3 Basic Powershell Commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've understood how `cmdlets` work - let's explore how to use them! The main thing to remember here is that `Get-Command` and `Get-Help` are your **best** friends! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Get-Help\n",
    "\n",
    "Get-Help displays information about a cmdlet. To get help with a particular command, run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Get-Help Command-Name`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also understand how exactly to use the command by passing in the `-examples` flag. This would return output like the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the Get-Help cmdlet to explain a command\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " `Get-Help Get-Command -Examples`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Get-Command\n",
    "**`Get-Command`** gets all the cmdlets installed on the current Computer. The great thing about this cmdlet is that it allows for pattern matching like the following\n",
    "\n",
    "`Get-Command Verb-* or Get-Command *-Noun`\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `Get-Command New-*` to view all the cmdlets for the verb new displays the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Get-Command to list all cmdlets installed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Get-Command New-*`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous task, we saw how the output of every cmdlet is an `object`. If we want to manipulate the output, we need to figure out a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- passing the output to other cmdlets\n",
    "\n",
    "- using specific object cmdlets to extract information\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pipeline `|` is used to pass output from one cmdlet to another. A major difference compared to other shells is that Powershell passes an **object** to the next cmdlet instead of passing text or string to the command after the pipe. Like every object in object-oriented frameworks, **an object will contain methods and properties**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of methods as functions that can be applied to output from the `cmdlet`, and you can think of properties as variables in the output from a cmdlet. To view these details, pass the output of a cmdlet to the `Get-Member` cmdlet:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Verb-Noun | Get-Member` \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of running this to view the members for Get-Command is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Get-Command | Get-Member -MemberType Method`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pipe (|) to pass output from one cmdlet to another\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "` Get-Command | Get-Member -MemberType Method`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above flag in the command, you can see that **you can also select between methods and properties**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Objects From Previous cmdlets\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of manipulating objects is pulling out the properties from the output of a cmdlet and creating a new object. This is done using the `Select-Object` cmdlet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of listing the directories and just selecting the `mode and the name`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Listing the directories and filtering via mode and name\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " `Get-ChildItem | Select-Object -Property Mode, Name`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the following flags to select particular information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- first - gets the first x object\n",
    "\n",
    "- last - gets the last x object\n",
    "\n",
    "- unique - shows the unique objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- skip - skips x objects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filtering Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "When retrieving output objects, *you may want to select objects that match a very specific value*. You can do this using the `Where-Object` to filter based on the value of properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general **format** for using this cmdlet is \n",
    "\n",
    "`Verb-Noun | Where-Object -Property PropertyName -operator Value`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Verb-Noun | Where-Object {$_.PropertyName -operator Value}`\n",
    "\n",
    "The second version uses the `$_` operator to *iterate through every object passed* to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Powershell is quite sensitive, so don't put quotes around the command!\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `-operator` is a list of the following operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains: if any item in the property value is an exact match for the specified value\n",
    "- EQ: if the property value is the same as the specified value\n",
    "- GT: if the property value is greater than the specified value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full list of operators, use this link.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of checking the stopped processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrating the use of operators only to show stopped services\n",
    "`Get-Service | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Stopped`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NTS**: need to learn about the formart of shell outputs and then maybe put them in a csv and analyze them using python. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a cmdlet outputs a lot of information, you may need to **sort it to extract the information more efficiently**. You do this by pipe-lining the output of a cmdlet to the `Sort-Object` cmdlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **format** of the command would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Verb-Noun | Sort-Object`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of sorting the list of directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Sort-Object cmdlet to sort piped information\n",
    "\n",
    "`Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object`\n",
    "\n",
