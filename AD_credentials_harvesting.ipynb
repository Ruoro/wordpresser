    "# Credentials Harvesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Credentials Harvesting is a term for gaining access to user and system credentials. It is a technique to look for or **steal stored credentials**, including network sniffing, where an attacker captures transmitted credentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Credentials can be found in a variety of different forms, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accounts details (usernames and passwords)\n",
    "- Hashes that include NTLM hashes, etc.\n",
    "- Authentication Tickets: Tickets Granting Ticket (TGT), Ticket Granting Server (TGS)\n",
    "- Any information that helps login into a system (private keys, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, there are two types of credential harvesting: **external** and **internal**. \n",
    "External credential harvesting most likely involves phishing emails and other techniques to trick a user into entering his username and password. If you want to learn more about phishing emails, we suggest trying the THM Phishing room. Obtaining credentials through the internal network uses different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this room, the focus will be on harvesting credentials from an **internal perspective** where a threat actor has already compromised a system and gained initial access. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a Windows Server 2019 configured as a Domain Controller. To follow the content discussed in this room, deploy the machine and move on to the next task.\n",

    "# Credential Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Credential access is where adversaries may find credentials in compromised systems and gain access to **user credentials**. It helps adversaries to reuse them or impersonate the identity of a user. This is an important step for lateral movement and accessing other resources such as other applications or systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining legitimate user credentials is preferred rather than exploiting systems using CVEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, you may visit the MITRE ATT&CK framework (TA0006).\n",
    "\n",
    "Credentials are stored insecurely in various locations in systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear-text files\n",
    "- Database files\n",
    "- Memory\n",
    "- Password managers\n",
    "- Enterprise Vaults\n",
    "- Active Directory\n",
    "- Network Sniffing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss them a bit more!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clear-text files\n",
    "\n",
    "*Attackers may search a compromised machine for credentials in local or remote file systems*. Clear-text files could include sensitive information created by a user, containing passwords, private keys, etc. The MITRE ATT&CK framework defines it as Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files (`T1552.001`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some of the types of clear-text files that an attacker may be interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commands history\n",
    "- Configuration files (Web App, FTP files, etc.)\n",
    "- Other Files related to Windows Applications (Internet Browsers, Email Clients, etc.)\n",
    "- Backup files\n",
    "- Shared files and folders\n",
    "- Registry\n",
    "- Source code \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of a history command, a PowerShell saves executed PowerShell commands in a history file in a user profile in the following path: `C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadLine\\ConsoleHost_history.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be worth checking what users are working on or finding sensitive information. Another example would be finding interesting information. For example, the following command is to look for the \"password\" keyword in the Window registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for the \"password\" keyword in the Registry\n",

    "#### Database Files \n",
    "\n",
    "Applications utilize database files to read or write settings, configurations, or *credentials*. Database files are usually stored locally in Windows operating systems. These files are an excellent target to check and hunt for credentials. For more information, we suggest checking `THM room: Breaching AD.` It contains a showcase example of extracting credentials from the local McAfee Endpoint database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Password Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "A password manager is an application to store and manage users' login information for local and Internet websites and services. Since it deals with users' data, it must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Password Manager applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built-in password managers (Windows)\n",
    "- Third-party: KeePass, 1Password, LastPass\n",
    "\n",
    "However, *misconfiguration* and *security flaws* are found in these applications that let adversaries access stored data. Various tools could be used during the enumeration stage to get sensitive data in password manager applications used by Internet browsers and desktop applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "This room will discuss how to access the Windows Credentials manager and extract passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Dump\n",
    "\n",
    "The Operating system's memory is a *rich source of sensitive information* that belongs to the Windows OS, users, and other applications. Data gets loaded into memory at run time or during the execution. Thus, accessing memory is limited to administrator users who fully control the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are examples of memory stored sensitive data, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear-text credentials\n",
    "- Cached passwords\n",
    "- AD Tickets\n",

    "#### Active Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Directory stores a lot of information related to users, groups, computers, etc. Thus, **enumerating the Active Directory environment** is one of the focuses of red team assessments. Active Directory has a solid design, but misconfiguration made by admins makes it vulnerable to various attacks shown in this room.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some of the Active Directory misconfigurations that may leak users' credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users' description: Administrators set a password in the description for new employees and leave it there, which makes the account vulnerable to unauthorized access. \n",
    "- Group Policy SYSVOL: Leaked encryption keys let attackers access administrator accounts. Check Task 8 for more information about the vulnerable version of SYSVOL.\n",
    "- NTDS: Contains AD users' credentials, making it a target for attackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "AD Attacks: Misconfiguration makes AD vulnerable to various attacks, which we will discuss in Task 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Network Sniffing\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaining initial access to a target network enables attackers to perform various network attacks against local computers, including the AD environment. The Man-In-the-Middle attack against network protocols lets the attacker create a rogue or spoof trusted resources within the network to steal authentication information such as NTLM hashes.\n",

    "Keylogger is a software or hardware device to monitor and log keyboard typing activities. Keyloggers were initially designed for legitimate purposes such as feedback for software development or parental control. However, they can be misused to steal data. As a red teamer, hunting for credentials through keyloggers in a busy and interactive environment is a good option. If we know a compromised target has a logged-in user, we can perform keylogging using tools like the Metasploit framework or others.\n",

    "The SAM is a Microsoft Windows database that contains local account information such as usernames and passwords. The SAM database stores these details in an encrypted format to make them harder to be retrieved. Moreover, it can not be read and accessed by any users while the Windows operating system is running. However, there are various ways and attacks to dump the content of the SAM database. \n",

    "\n",
    "More specifically, we will be using wmic to create a shadow volume copy. This has to be done through the command prompt with administrator privileges as follows,\n",

    "\n",
    "**Local Security Authority Server Service** (LSASS) is a Windows process that handles the operating system security policy and enforces it on a system. It verifies logged in accounts and ensures passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets. Windows system stores credentials in the LSASS process to *enable users to access network resources*, such as file shares, SharePoint sites, and other network services, without entering credentials every time a user connects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the LSASS process is a juicy target for red teamers because it stores sensitive information about user accounts. The LSASS is commonly abused to **dump credentials** to either escalate privileges, steal data, or move laterally. Luckily for us, if we have administrator privileges, we can dump the process memory of LSASS. Windows system allows us to create a dump file, a snapshot of a given process. This could be done either with the Desktop access (GUI) or the command prompt. This attack is defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework as \"OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory (`T1003`)\".\n",

    "- Windows credentials contain Windows authentication details, such as NTLM or Kerberos.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generic credentials contain basic authentication details, such as clear-text usernames and passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Certificate-based credentials: These are authentication details based on certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that authentication details are stored on the **user's folder** and are not shared among Windows user accounts. However, they are cached in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Credential Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the Windows Credential Manager through GUI **(Control Panel -> User Accounts -> Credential Manager)** or the command prompt. In this task, the focus will be more on the command prompt scenario where the GUI is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows Credential Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the Microsoft Credentials Manager `vaultcmd` utility. Let's start to enumerate if there are any stored credentials. First, we list the current windows vaults available in the Windows target. \n",
    "\n",
    "Listing the Available Credentials from the Credentials Manager\n",
    "`vaultcmd /list`\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Windows has two vaults, one for Web and the other one for Windows machine credentials. The above output confirms that we have the two default vaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check if there are any stored credentials in the Web Credentials vault by running the `vaultcmd` command with `/listproperties`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking if there Are any Stored Credentials in the \"Web Credentials.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`VaultCmd /listproperties:\"Web Credentials\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows that we have one stored credential in the specified vault. Now let's try to list more information about the stored credential as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "Listing Credentials Details for \"Web Credentials\"\n",
    "`VaultCmd /listcreds:\"Web Credentials\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Credential Dumping\n",
    "\n",
    "The `VaultCmd` is not able to show the password, but we can rely on other PowerShell Scripts such as `Get-WebCredentials.ps1`, which is already included in the attached VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure to execute PowerShell with bypass policy to import it as a module as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Clean-text Password from Web Credentials\n",

    "` Get-WebCredentials`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows that we obtained the username and password for accessing the internal application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RunAs\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method of taking advantage of stored credentials is by using `RunAs`. RunAs is a command-line built-in tool that **allows running Windows** applications or tools **under different users' permissions**. The RunAs tool has various command arguments that could be used in the Windows system. The `/savecred` argument allows you to save the credentials of the user in Windows Credentials Manager (under the Windows Credentials section). So, the next time we execute as the same user, runas will not ask for a password.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply it to the attached Windows machine. Another way to enumerate stored credentials is by using `cmdkey`, which is a *tool to* create, delete, and display stored Windows credentials. By providing the `/list` argument, we can show all stored credentials, or we can specify the credential to display more details `/list:computername`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumerating for Stored Windows Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "`cmdkey /list`\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows that we have a domain password stored as the `thm\\thm-local` user. Note that stored credentials could be for other servers too. Now let's use runas to execute Windows applications as the thm-local user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run CMD.exe As a User with the /savecred argument\n",
    "`runas /savecred /user:THM.red\\thm-local cmd.exe`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A new `cmd.exe` pops up with a command prompt ready to use. Now run the `whoami` command to confirm that we are running under the desired user. There is a flag in the `c:\\Users\\thm-local\\Saved Games\\flag.txt`, try to read it and answer the question below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mimikatz\n",
    "\n",
    "Mimikatz is a tool that can dump clear-text passwords stored in the Credential Manager from memory. The steps are similar to those shown in the previous section (Memory dump), but we can specify to show the credentials manager section only this time.\n",

    "# Task 7 This task discusses the required steps to dump Domain Controller Hashes locally and remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NTDS Domain Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Technologies Directory Services** (NTDS) is a database containing all Active Directory data, including objects, attributes, credentials, etc. The NTDS.DTS data consists of three tables as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Schema table: it contains types of objects and their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Link table: it contains the object's attributes and their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data type: It contains users and groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "NTDS is located in `C:\\Windows\\NTDS` by default, and it is encrypted to prevent data extraction from a target machine. Accessing the `NTDS.dit` file from the machine running is disallowed since the file is used by Active Directory and is locked. \n",
    "However, there are various ways to gain access to it. This task will discuss how to get a copy of the NTDS file using the `ntdsutil` and `Diskshadow` tool and finally how to dump the file's content. It is important to note that decrypting the NTDS file requires a **system Boot Key** to attempt to decrypt LSA Isolated credentials, which is stored in the SECURITY file system. Therefore, we must also dump the `security` file containing all required files to decrypt. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ntdsutil\n",
    "\n",
    "Ntdsutil is a Windows utility to used manage and maintain Active Directory configurations. It can be used in various scenarios such as \n",
    "\n",
    "- Restore deleted objects in Active Directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform maintenance for the AD database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Active Directory snapshot management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) administrator passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about Ntdsutil, you may visit the Microsoft documentation page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local Dumping (No Credentials)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually done if you have no credentials available but have administrator access to the domain controller. Therefore, we will be relying on Windows utilities to dump the NTDS file and crack them offline. As a requirement, first, we assume we have administrator access to a domain controller. \n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully dump the content of the NTDS file we need the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "`C:\\Windows\\NTDS\\ntds.dit`\n",
    "`C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SYSTEM`\n",
    "`C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SECURITY`\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a one-liner PowerShell command to dump the NTDS file using the Ntdsutil tool in the `C:\\temp` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dumping the content of the NTDS file from the Victim Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "`powershell \"ntdsutil.exe 'ac i ntds' 'ifm' 'create full c:\\temp' q q\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we check the `c:\\temp` directory, we see two folders: Active Directory and registry, which contain the three files we need. \n",
    "Transfer them to the AttackBox and run the `secretsdump.py` script to extract the hashes from the dumped memory file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract hashes from NTDS Locally (Attack box)\n",
    "`python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -security path/to/SECURITY -system path/to/SYSTEM -ntds path/to/ntds.dit local`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remote Dumping (With Credentials)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we discussed how to get hashes from memory with no credentials in hand. In this task, we will be showing how to dump a system and domain controller hashes remotely, which requires credentials, such as passwords or NTLM hashes. We also need credentials for users with administrative access to a domain controller or special permissions as discussed in the DC Sync section.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### DC Sync\n",
    "\n",
    "The DC Sync is a popular attack to perform within an Active Directory environment to dump credentials remotely. This attack works when an account (*special account with necessary permissions*) or *AD admin account* is compromised that has the following AD permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replicating Directory Changes\n",
    "- Replicating Directory Changes All\n",
    "- Replicating Directory Changes in Filtered Set\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An adversary takes advantage of these configurations to perform *domain replication*, commonly referred to as \"DC Sync\", or Domain Controller Sync. For more information about the DC Sync attack, you can visit the THM Persisting AD room (Task 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Persisting AD room uses the Mimikatz tool to perform the** DC Synchronisation attack**. Let's demonstrate the attack using a different tool, such as the Impacket SecretsDump script. \n",

    "Let's explain the command a bit more.\n",
    "\n",
    "the `-just-dc` argument is for extracting the NTDS data.\n",
    "the `thm.red/AD_Admin_User` is the authenticated domain user in the form of (domain/user).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we obtained hashes, we can either use the hash for a specific user to impersonate him or crack the hash using Cracking tools, such `hashcat`. We can use the `hashcat -m 1000` mode to crack the Windows NTLM hashes as follows:\n",

    "# Task 8 Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)\n",
    "\n",
    "This task discusses *how to enumerate and obtain a local administrator password* within the Active Directory environment if a `LAPS` feature is configured and *enabled*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Group Policy Preferences (GPP)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Windows OS has a built-in Administrator account which can be accessed using a password. Changing passwords in a large Windows environment with many computers is challenging. Therefore, Microsoft implemented a method to change local administrator accounts across workstations using **Group Policy Preferences (GPP)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPP is a tool that allows administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. Once the GPP is deployed, different XML files are created in the `SYSVOL` folder. SYSVOL is an essential component of Active Directory and creates a shared directory on an *NTFS volume* that all authenticated domain users can access with reading permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue was the GPP relevant XML files contained a *password encrypted using` AES-256 bit` encryption*. At that time, the encryption was good enough until Microsoft somehow published its private key on `MSDN`. Since Domain users can read the content of the SYSVOL folder, it becomes easy to decrypt the stored passwords. One of the tools to crack the SYSVOL encrypted password is `Get-GPPPassword`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, Microsoft removed storing the encrypted password in the `SYSVOL` folder. It introduced the **Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)**, which offers a much more secure approach to remotely managing the local administrator password.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new method includes two new attributes (`ms-mcs-AdmPwd` and `ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime`) of computer objects in the Active Directory. The `ms-mcs-AdmPwd` attribute contains a clear-text password of the local administrator, while the `ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime` contains the expiration time to reset the password. \n",
    "LAPS uses **admpwd.dll** to change the local administrator password and update the value of `ms-mcs-AdmPwd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enumerate for LAPS\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided VM has the LAPS enabled, so let's start enumerating it. First, we check if LAPS is installed in the target machine, which can be done by checking the admpwd.dll path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumerating for LAPS\n",
    "````console\n",
    "dir \"C:\\Program Files\\LAPS\\CSE\"\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The output confirms that we have LAPS on the machine. Let's check the available commands to use for AdmPwd cmdlets as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "Listing the available PowerShell cmdlets for LAPS\n",
    "```console\n",
    "Get-Command *AdmPwd*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, we need to find which AD organizational unit (OU) has the \"All extended rights\" attribute that deals with LAPS. We will be using the \"Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights\" cmdlet to provide the right OU. Note that getting the available OUs could be done in the enumeration step. Our OU target in this example is THMorg. You can use the -Identity *  argument to list all available OUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Users with AdmPwdExtendedRights Attribute\n",
    "```console\n",
    "Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights -Identity THMorg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows that the THMGroupReader group in THMorg has the right access to LAPS. Let's check the group and its members.\n",

    "# Task 9 Other Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tasks, the assumption is that we already had initial access to a system and were trying to obtain credentials from memory or various files within the Windows operating system. \n",
    "In other scenarios, it is possible to perform attacks in a victim network to obtain credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task will briefly introduce some of the Windows and AD attacks that can be used to obtain the hashes. Before diving into more AD attack details, we suggest being familiar with **Kerberos protocol** and **New Technology LAN Manage**r (NTLM), a suite of security protocols used to authenticate users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kerberoasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Kerberoasting is a **common AD attack** to obtain AD tickets that helps with persistence. In order for this attack to work, an adversary must have access to **SPN (Service Principal Name)** accounts such as *IIS User, MSSQL, etc*. The Kerberoasting attack involves requesting a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Ticket Granting Service (TGS). \n",
    "\n",
    "This attack's end goal is to enable privilege escalation and lateral network movement. For more details about the attack, you can visit the THM Persisting AD room (Task 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a quick demo about the attack. First, we need to find an SPN account(s), and then we can send a request to get a TGS ticket. We will perform the Kerberoasting attack from the AttackBox using the `GetUserSPNs.py` python script. Remember to use the `THM.red/thm` account with `Passw0rd!` as a password.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumerating for SPN Accounts\n",
    " ````console\n",
    "python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 10.10.60.207 THM.red/thm\n",
    "````\n",
    "I\n",
    "The previous command is straightforward: we provide the* Domain Controller IP address and the domain name\\username*. Then the `GetUserSPNs` script asks for the `user's password` to retrieve the required information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output revealed that we have an SPN account, `svc-user`. Once we find the SPN user, we can `send a single request to get a TGS ticket` for the `srv-user` user using the `-request-user` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requesting a TGS Ticket as SPN Account\n",
    "`python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 10.10.60.207 THM.red/thm -request-user svc-user `\n",
    "\n",

    "Try replicating the steps against the attached VM by finding the SPN user and then performing the Kerberoasting attack. Once you have obtained the ticket, crack it and answer the question below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AS-REP Roasting\n",
    "\n",
    "AS-REP Roasting is the technique that **enables the attacker to retrieve password hashes** for AD users whose account options have been set to \"**Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication**\". This option relies on the old Kerberos authentication protocol, which allows authentication without a password. Once we obtain the hashes, we can try to crack it offline, and finally, if it is crackable, we got a password!\n",
    "\n",
    "AS-REP Roasting\n",
    "\n",
    "The attached VM has one of the AD users configured with the \"Do not require Kerberos preauthentication\" setting. Before performing the AS-REP Roasting, we need a list of domain accounts that should be gathered from the enumeration step. In our case, we created a users.lst list in the tmp directory. The following is the content of our list, which should be gathered during the enumeration process.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We specified the IP address of the domain controller with the `-dc-ip` argument and provided a list of domain users to check against. Once the tool finds the right user with no preauthentication configuration, it will generate the ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various cybersecurity and hacking tools also *allow cracking the TGTs* harvested from Active Directory, including `Rubeus` and `Hashcat`. Impacket `GetNPUsers` has the option to export tickets as John or hashcat format using the `-format` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SMB Relay Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "The SMB Relay attack *abuses the NTLM authentication mechanism* (NTLM challenge-response protocol). The attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle attack to monitor and capture SMB packets and extract hashes. \n",
    "For this attack to work, the SMB signing must be disabled. SMB signing is a security check for integrity and ensures the communication is between trusted sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest checking the THM Exploiting AD room for more information about the SMB relay attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LLMNR/NBNS Poisoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)** and **NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS)** help local network machines to find the right machine if DNS fails. For example, suppose a machine within the network tries to communicate with no existing DNS record (DNS fails to resolve). In that case, the machine sends multicast messages to all network machines asking for the correct address via `LLMNR` or `NBT-NS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBNS/LLMNR Poisoning occurs when an attacker `spoofs an authoritative source` on the network and responds to the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) traffic to the requested host with host identification service. If you want to learn more about the attack, we suggest checking THM Breaching AD room.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal for SMB relay and LLMNR/NBNS Poisoning attacks is to capture authentication NTLM hashes for a victim, which helps obtain access to the victim's account or machine. \n",
